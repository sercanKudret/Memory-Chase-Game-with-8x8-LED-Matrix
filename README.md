# Memory-Chase-Game-with-8x8-LED-Matrix

A game developed using an 8x8 dot matrix display and 5 buttons with a PIC16F877A microcontroller. In each level, LEDs blink in random positions. The player uses 4 directional buttons to move a cursor LED and selects the correct position using the OK button. As levels progress, the number of blinking LEDs increases and the player must follow the correct sequence. A wrong selection triggers a buzzer and restarts the level.
